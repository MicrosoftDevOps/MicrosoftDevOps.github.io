## Learning from Hackfest with *Azzimov* ##

Azzimov teamed up with Microsoft during a few days to implement DevOps practices. The main focuse was put on increasing quality and reliability. We will describe in this report the steps we have taken and their results.

Among other things we talked about:
* Unit Testing
* Continuous Integration with Jenkins
* Continuous Deployment
* Integration Testing

The hacking team included:
* Yassine
* Yan
* Prasad
* Kevork
* William
* Julien
 
## Customer Profile ##
Azzimov is a startup based in Montr√©al, Canada which delivers a virtual shopping mall solution leveraging machine learning.

## Problem Statement ##

Azzimov was having quality issues when deploying new releases: Due to the lack of automated test, they had no way to ensure a certain quality of their product before pushing it in production.

This is a very usual situation in small to medium companies.

### Current Architecture ###

[Architecture overview picture]

Azzimov's architecutre is very granular with each component being isolated. This is a very good practice that makes changing any one of the components much easier (that was great for our hackfest :) ). 
It would also greatly simplify moving to a container based architecture, but that's for another day.
 
## Solutions, Steps, and Delivery ##

Value Stream Mapping description and how it helped in the exercise


* Setting up a Jenkins on Azure using ARM template.
* Setting up Continuous integration in jenkins (build, test, upload package)
* Continuous deployment to the dev environment in jenkins
* Creation of a new integration test java project to automate recurring manual test on the previously deployed environment such as
	* Ensuring correct connection to MySQL
