# Learnings from a DevOps Hackfest with Genetec #

**Question: Wasn't the team actually trying to bring DevOps practices and mindset to Genetec? Or maybe to their production environment? Rather than to Stratocast.**

Genetec teamed up with Microsoft to bring DevOps practices and a DevOps mindset to Stratocast, a cloud-based video monitoring system.
During this short event, the hack team touched on many DevOps practices, including:
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Integration testing, UI testing, and more
- Cross-department collaboration

## The Hack team ##
The team for this event consisted of the following key individuals from Genetec, joined by technical evangelists from Microsoft.

**Genetec**
* Simon le bourdais Cabana - product owner
* Racha Karout - test engineer team lead
* Gregoire Wolf - system test team leader
* Paul Evans - backend system test champion
* Parvez-Alam - lead cloud Ops engineer
* Sébastien Nadeau - backend developer team Lead
* David Chapdelaine - backend developer
* Francisco Davila - backend developer
* Yakim Mandjee - backend developer
* Patterson Deshomme - backend developer
* Louis-Phillipe Jetté - backend developer

**Microsoft**
* David Tesar [(@dtzar)](https://twitter.com/dtzar) - senior DevOps technical evangelist
* Julien Stroheker [(@Ju_stroh)](https://twitter.com/Ju_Stroh) - DevOps technical evangelist
* William Buchwalter [(@wbuchw)](https://twitter.com/wbuchw) - DevOps technical evangelist

## Customer profile ##
Genetec is a global provider of IP video surveillance, access control, and license plate recognition solutions unified in a single platform, called **Security Center**, which they built in Microsoft Azure. They work with partners worldwide to help provide safer, more secure environments for small to medium-sized and enterprise-class businesses in more than 80 countries.

Genetec was present at our Microsoft DevOps Hackathon training event in Montreal in March 2016; during that two-day event, we introduced them to some DevOps concepts and showed them how to embrace a DevOps mindset.

Three months later, we teamed up with Genetec for a Hackfest (Figure 1) with a goal of improving and implementing some DevOps practices in their current production environment.

During our Hackfest, we worked mainly on the back end of the Security Center solution.

**Comment: It's unclear what the Hackfest connection is between Security Center and Stratocast. This report seems to focus more on Stratocast, although it says the work focus was on Security Center.**

Genetec had launched an offering called Stratocast, a camera security center that is 100% cloud-based—no devices installed on premises. The idea is to offer a “Plug and Play” experience with cameras, without the need for firewalls or networking, for example. The targets of this offering are small and medium-sized enterprises.

Behind the scenes, Stratocast uses the same binaries as the enterprise-wide solution, Security Center, but in a SaaS mode because of Azure. In terms of architecture on Azure, the application uses:

**Questions about below list: Is it 4 to 5? (rather than four/fifths.) Should it be "worker roles"? Is "storages" supposed to be plural, or should it be "storage accounts"?**

* Cloud Services with 4/5 workers role
* Azure Queue
* Azure SQL databases
* Storages account

*Figure 2: Architecture overview*
![Figure 2: Architecture Overview](/images/genetec2.jpg)

**Comment: I don't see a blue square in Figure 2.**

We focused our technical efforts mainly on the part within the blue square in Figure 2, which represents the backend solution, using a Cloud Services architecture on Microsoft Azure.

**Question: Is it 800 megabytes? If so, it should be MB (not Mb).**

This current piece of code is a monolithic application and the size of the artifact (.exe) of Security Center is around 800 MB.

## Problem statement ##

Our first objective was to create a mapping of the full value stream, from ideation to delivery in production. By doing this we are able to identify bottlenecks and find the most pressing pain points.

The Value Stream Mapping (VSM) exercise took place during the first day and a half. While it may seem long, it is important not to underestimate the value of this exercise, as it is often the first time the team is exposed to a global view of the overall process, extending well outside their respective departments. It also leads to very interesting open discussions.

Figure 3 shows the result of our Value Stream Mapping activity.

*Figure 3: Value Stream Mapping*
![Figure 3: Value Stream Mapping](/images/genetec3.jpg)

One difficulty during the VSM activity was that the process is constantly evolving and not well documented. We decided to use the most recent release as a base for the exercise.

Based on the VSM, we estimated the total lead time (from ideation to deployed in production) to be around **8 months**, which was consistent with the previous releases.

Two areas are notably painful: Dev and QA, with around 3 months lead time each. The problem is a very common one: **large batch size**.

Features are developed on separate branches, and usually are a month long. Since multiple features are delivered in a single release, the development team usually works in a silo for several months before deeming their work ready for release, at which point they create a new release branch and the system test team starts the QA phase.

Since the changes after several months are so numerous, the test team has to check the integrity of the whole system, which takes a lot of time as well.

This creates a vicious circle: Since integration and testing are painful, the initial reaction is to do the least possible, making them exponentially more painful. A better approach is to do integration and testing as often as possible, and incrementally work on improving the pipeline. **Small batch size is key.**

On the technical level, the situation is made worse by the lack of automation: no Continuous Integration existed, and the automated test suite is unreliable, slow, and triggered manually.

Deployments also are triggered manually. A custom tool is used to correctly configure the environment. It’s complicated for the team to deploy their solution on Azure just to test it. Lastly, since no load test exists, release in production is a very long and critical process to ensure minimum risk for their customers: new releases are rolled out to an incrementally larger subset of their customers every week during the course of a month.

The goal of the VSM exercise was to identify pain points and shortcomings, but it also revealed several points that were very encouraging:

**Comment: Please add links to SpecFlow and Selenium.**

* Genetec employees are very honest regarding the current state of their processes, and have a “can do” mindset. They acted as a real team to find possible countermeasures and did not spend time blaming anyone. This is the kind of environment where a DevOps culture can really grow.
* While deployments need to be triggered manually, they are already well automated.
* Some unit tests are already in place, and the team understands the value of adding more in the future.
* Integration testing, while very long and unreliable, is automated, and the team is willing to improve their quality and performance.
* Functional tests are also already in place, using a very interesting combination of SpecFlow and Selenium. Once again, they need to be triggered manually.
* Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2015 update 2 is already in use, and other teams at Genetec have significant experience with it.

Based on this we decided to focus on bridging the existing parts together in an automated fashion with the goal of **reducing the feedback cycle** and ultimately the lead time of development and quality assurance.

## Solutions, steps, and delivery ##

**Question: Can we change "actors" to "owners"?**

When we discussed the backend application with Genetec, we understood that every step from development to production was manual. Each build was triggered manually from the TFS server and each step required a manual operation carried out by different actors.

However, they had built tools with some automated parts to help them, such as:

* “Stratocastor,” which allows them to prepare, deploy, and monitor the Cloud Service deployment on Azure.
* A number of automated tests.
* Pieces of scripts on different steps.

But they had nothing to orchestrate and manage all the steps in the pipeline—from the simple check-in of code to the release on Azure with the tests on top of it! That’s where we focused our effort during the Hackfest. We started to explore the actual pipeline at the highest level.


*Figure 4: Pipeline in QA*
![Figure 4: Pipeline in QA](/images/genetec4.jpg)

We found that these four steps (Figure 4) in the pipeline were executed with different tools and little action between them. Completion of one step did not trigger the next, which could result in lost time between steps. We also identified an important scrape/rate on the automated testing step; the tests had to be rerun a few times to be sure everything was well executed.

One of the biggest bottlenecks in terms of time was system testing. It took three months to execute this step.

Based on all of this, we decided to work on the Continuous Integration feature and see how to implement it on Security Center.

### Continuous Integration ###

**Question: Does "creating a new one" mean creating a new build process?**

We decided to work on the post-build process of Security Center so as not to impact the current build process and do so by creating a new one that will be executed after the current build.

*Figure 5: Post-build step*

![Figure 5:Post-Build step](/images/genetec5.jpg)

In this new simple build, we prepared the package to be deployed automatically in the release. The goal was to eliminate the manual operation with the custom tool Stratocastor and deploy our application automatically as often as possible on Azure.

We quickly understood the pain of having an actual artifact of 800 MB, and the reality that we could not build it every few minutes.

Here are the steps that we implemented in this short build:

* Ran some PowerShell scripts to map the artifact folder of this new build to the previous one on the file share.
* Copied the template service configuration and package files (.cscfg and .cspkg) in the artifact folder.
* Added seven unit tests to the process to test the feature, for the moment.

*Figure 6: Build definition*

![Figure 6:Build definition](/images/genetec6.png)

David Chapdelaine, one of the developers, was quite satisfied to see the results live in TFS. He thought being able to see the results directly in the build process report could encourage people to use and implement it. He also liked the “Code Coverage” feature that, for example, allows them to see the number of lines in the code, etc.

Figure 7 shows an example of a unit test report during a build.

*Figure 7: Unit test results*

![Figure 7:Unit test results](/images/genetec7.png)

After having this new build, we also wanted to automatically execute it.
Francisco Davila, worked on a custom script that starts this new build when the previous one is done.

*Figure 8: New build connection*

![Figure 8:New build connection](/images/genetec8.png)

### Release Management and Continuous Delivery ###

The next big step, which was also new to the team, was the release: the ability to deploy automatically from a build to Azure and run all the tests. Figure 9 shows the steps in the release that we implemented.

*Figure 9: Steps in the release*

![Figure 9:Unit test results](/images/genetec9.png)

From the previous build that we had just created, we had the .exe solution plus the deployment files for the Cloud Service on Azure, which we called the “artifacts.”

**Question: Unsure about the word "definition" below. What were you defining?**

Here are the main steps of our definition:

1.	The first step is to upload the .exe package somewhere accessible on Azure: a blob storage.
2.	We “tokenize” the deployment file (XML) thanks [Release Management Utility tasks] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.utilitytasks) extension
3.	We deploy our new cloud service thanks to the deployment file that we just customized one step before
    * When the Cloud Service is deployed on Azure, the virtual machine inside calls a bootstrap script (.CMD) that will download and install the .exe solution on it.
4.	We wait to have the “Callback” from the Cloud Services which indicates that the solution is installed inside the Cloud Services
5.	We copy some files mandatory to run our tests
6.	We run these tests to validate this new environment

We also add the possibility to destroy or not this environment at the end of the deployment.
Team Foundation Services, is now doing the same manual steps that “Stratocaster”, the custom tool, did but automatically.

Now, that we identified the process and the solution to deploy the package on Azure, this sequence can be run at each deployment if we want:

*Figure 10: Continuous Deployment*

![Figure 10:Continuous Deployment](/images/genetec10.png)

### Functional UI testing ###

As mentioned earlier, a comprehensive functional test suite already existed, but was triggered manually, and only during the QA phase.
In our pursuit of short feedback loops, making these tests run frequently and automatically is vital. We decided to integrate them into a new release definition.

These functional tests are written with SpecFlow (Which is Cucumber for .NET), which is an awesome tool for writing tests in plain language, making them readable by anyone, thus becoming a living documentation of the system.

Here is an example of a very basic SpecFlow test (unrelated to Genetec):  

{% highlight bash %}
Feature: US01 - Book Search
	As a potential customer
	I want to search for books by a simple phrase
	So that I can easily allocate books by something I remember from them.

Background:
	Given the following books
		|Author        |Title								
		|Martin Fowler |Analysis Patterns					
		|Eric Evans    |Domain Driven Design				

Scenario: Title should be matched
	When I search for books by the phrase 'Domain'
	Then the list of found books should contain only: 'Domain Driven Design'
{% endhighlight %}

And the implementation behind it (A lot of stuff has been omitted to fit in the page, this are just the interesting bits):

{% highlight csharp %}
public partial class US01_BookSearchFeature
{        
  public virtual void FeatureBackground()
  {
      TechTalk.SpecFlow.Table table1 = new TechTalk.SpecFlow.Table(new string[] {
                  "Author",
                  "Title"});
      table1.AddRow(new string[] {
                  "Martin Fowler",
                  "Analysis Patterns"});
      table1.AddRow(new string[] {
                  "Eric Evans",
                  "Domain Driven Design"});

      testRunner.Given("the following books", ((string)(null)), table1);
  }

  [TechTalk.SpecRun.ScenarioAttribute("Title should be matched")]
  public virtual void TitleShouldBeMatched()
  {
      TechTalk.SpecFlow.ScenarioInfo scenarioInfo = new TechTalk.SpecFlow.ScenarioInfo("Title should be matched", ((string[])(null)));
      testRunner.When("I search for books by the phrase \'Domain\'");
      testRunner.Then("the list of found books should contain only: \'Domain Driven Design\'");
  }

}

[Binding, Scope(Tag = "web")]
public class SearchSteps : SeleniumStepsBase
{
   [When(@"I search for books by the phrase '(.*)'")]
   public void WhenISearchForBooksByThePhrase(string searchTerm)
   {
       selenium.NavigateTo("Home");
       selenium.SetTextBoxValue("searchTerm", searchTerm);
       selenium.SubmitForm("searchForm");
   }

   [Then(@"the list of found books should contain only: '(.*)'")]
   public void ThenTheListOfFoundBooksShouldContainOnly(string expectedTitleList)
   {
       var foundBooks = selenium.FindElements(By.XPath("//table/tbody/tr"))
           .Select(row => new Book()
           {
               Title = row.FindElement(By.ClassName("title")).Text,
               Author = row.FindElement(By.ClassName("author")).Text,
           }).ToList();
       var expectedTitles = expectedTitleList.Split(',').Select(t => t.Trim().Trim('\''));

       BookAssertions.FoundBooksShouldMatchTitles(foundBooks, expectedTitles);
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

At runtime, these tests use Selenium to interact with the UI, which requires a browser to run.
We decided to go with the simplest solution first: Create a custom build agent with a browser installed on it.  

*In the future, [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) could be used instead of a real browser. This would allow selenium tests to run even on a hosted agent, and would open the door for advanced scenarios like runnint multiple phantomjs instance in parallel, each executing a different subset of the functional tests.
[This blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/01/27/getting-started-with-selenium-testing-in-a-continuous-integration-pipeline-with-visual-studio/) gives some hints on how to do that.*  

These tests need to pass a *.testsetting* file to vstest.exe to run correctly.
It turned out to be quite problematic as the VSTest task in Visual Studio Team Services didn’t  seem to accept it.

We opened an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/1618) , and quickly found the root of the issue as well as a workaround with the help of VSTS’s product team. A fix for this bug should be included in the next sprint!

After some struggling, here is the result of running these tests:

*Figure 11: Functional testing*

![Figure 11:Functional testing](/images/genetec11.png)

While there are many failed test, we were very pleased with the outcome! Most of the failures are due to incorrect configuration and not to an inherent problem with our approach. Everything should pass with a little bit of tweaking.

Currently, a run will clock at around three hours, which is too long to be part of a CI pipeline, but it shouldn’t be too hard to improve them with a little bit of ingenuity. In the meantime, these tests can either be run on a schedule (every night for example), or every X commits, which will already be a big improvement.

## Conclusion ##

This hackfest held the opportunity to have different people from different teams and departments. A good example is when the test team shared their methodology regarding the “System Testing” and explained the reason why it takes them three months of lead time to pass through it.
We identified some potential double work between the Back End and the Front End team on the testing part.

The reality is that both teams are using a kind of simulator for the cameras to test some scenarios like:

* Add a camera in the system
* Remove a camera
* Stream video from the camera
* 	…

This kind of scenarios was executed by both teams at each release. To remediate to this scenario, we decided to deploy an integration environment with the latest release of each part: Front End + Back End and run all of the tests automatically in this one.
Each team has its own lifecycle with different artifacts at the end. Every night, Genetec triggered a deployment, grabbed the latest artifacts on the both parts from each build process and deployed it in a common environment called “Integration” and ran all the tests on it.

*Figure 12: Integration Environment*

![Figure 12:Integration Environment](/images/genetec12.png)

Thanks to this process, every morning each team and each developer can see their work from the previous day in one common environment.
A good way to continuously integrate in production for Genetec.
Integrating DevOps practices into a several years old monolithic solution is never easy, but Genetec’s team really did a great job in the limited time we had. We were able to setup a skeleton for a full continuous delivery pipeline that will be built upon in the future.

Of course, implementing automation across all the pipeline and being able to continuously deliver value is a long journey, but the team had some great ideas for the future:

* Having a single Kanban board for the whole process, avoiding local optimizations.
* Splitting the monolith into several smaller independent components, that could each be released at a different rate;
* Finding the manual tests that are run every time and automate them, to reduce the lead time of the QA phase;
* Improve performance of integration and functional tests. Faster tests mean that they can be run more often: shorter feedback loops;
* The Hackfest allowed to engage conversations between the backend and frontend teams and to realize that some tests can be executed together and furthermore optimize the use of each team’s time;


## General lessons ##

One week is a very short time to change processes and practices. But the most important lesson Genetec learned is about working as a team.
They realized the importance and impact of cross-department communication:
* Avoid local optimizations
* Avoid duplicated work (for example, dev and test engineer both doing a same set of tests).
* Having a better knowledge of other departments processes, allowing anyone to pitch-in if needed.

While having Microsoft on site is certainly a catalyst for such events, organizations that want to improve should definitely consider taking some time to organize something similar.
In most companies, collaboration between departments is often kept to a minimum, each having separate objectives.
Hackfest like events are a unique way to break these silos and plant the seed for a DevOps mindset, helping your organization answer questions such as:
* How could we reduce our time to market?
* Could we automate some tasks to be more productive and reduce errors?
* Could we get actionable customer feedback earlier?

This kind of exercise is better known as a Kaizen event which is part of the [Kaizen movement (Continuous Improvement)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen).
