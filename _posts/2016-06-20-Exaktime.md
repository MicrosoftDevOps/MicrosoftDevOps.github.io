## Lowering lead time and improving visibility with Exaktime ##

Microsoft helped out Exaktime via two different hackfests to do a value stream map of their current software delivery processes and make improvements with DevOps practices.  The following DevOps practices were implemented:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Release Management

Core Hack Team:
- Erik Renken - Senior Software Architect, Exaktime
- Adam Freehling - Software Engineer, Exaktime
- David Tesar [(@dtzar)](http://twitter.com/dtzar) - Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft 
> Note: a larger team was present for the value stream map exercise, but these were the core participants of the implementation hackfest.
 
## Customer Profile ##
Exaktime eliminates the need for handwritten paper time cards at job sites with innovative time tracking solutions.  The focus of the hackfest was related to their core customer front-end services and back-end APIs which run their time tracking software.  The time tracking software all run as Azure App services.

 
## Problem Statement ##


Exaktime used different tools for work item tracking (Target Process), source code repository (Plastic SCM), and central build, test, and deployment (Jenkins). Although Jenkins was setup to do continuous integration and deployment to specific environments, the releases between environments was done manually and new builds were generated from the same version of source code control between each environment.  At any given time, it was challenging for anyone to determine what environment their code resided on and when it might be time for that code to be ready to move to the next environment to go to production.  Furthermore, quite a bit of effort was required to pull together information across these separate tools to have visibility of which work items were related to a release, what commits into source code control were happening against those work items, and what builds contained what work items.  There was no hard set rule on when a release happened and it would take around a month or more to get even a single feature into production.

Their product has 5 different front-end services (Documents, Identity, Provisioning, Reports, and Web) with backend APIs and they are all run on top of Azure App services.  They had one Visual Studio SLN file that built all of these and more and one source code repository for this solution.  Builds usually took an hour or longer which slowed down development and delayed feedback from automated tests in Jenkins.  Also the Jenkins server was a single virtual machine that had to be maintained with OS-level and task patches, required scheduled reboots, and occasionally was down interfering with the overall development life cycle.
 
## Solutions, Steps, and Delivery ##


Value Stream Mapping helped Exaktime to determine what their real lead time was and find where the biggest improvements could be made to their overall process of delivery from ideation to production.  The following areas were decided as key areas to focus on improving:

	Better visibility into work items, code commits, and deployment pipeline 

	Move towards true Continuous Integration 
	
	Implement Release Management

###Better visibility into work items, code commits, and deployment pipeline###

Exaktime decided to migrate their work item tracking system (TargetProcess) and source code control (Plastic SCM) to Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) using the VSTS agile process template and VSTS git repositories.  They did this migration on their own outside of a Microsoft assisted hackfest.  This made it much easier to see the connection between the work items and the code being committed.  

To continue to have visibility through the entire deployment pipeline to production, Exaktime needed to evaluate the tools available to move those corresponding work items and code commits into builds and builds through the necessary environments into production.  Exaktime didn't want to have to spend time to maintain their Jenkins implementation, so they really needed a service as opposed to any other tool which they would also have to maintain.  They liked the capabilities of VSTS build and release management and the visibility it could provide for their work items, code commits, builds, and deployments. VSTS was a natural fit and Microsoft helped to replace Jenkins with VSTS.  VSTS was able to complete all of the same functionality as they were using Jenkins for including doing continuous integration and automated tests, but now they had the added bonus of being able to easily see their work items, code commits, builds, AND tests which failed from a central location.

Jenkins continuous deployment functionality was handled by a PowerShell script deploying to Azure app services and was replaced with VSTS Release Management and the Azure websites deployment task as covered below.
 
###Move towards true Continuous Integration###

Exaktime already had the "loose" definition of continuous integration enabled - namely that when they checked in code to their branch, Jenkins would automatically start unit tests and create a build if those tests passed.  This is useful although the biggest delays were in getting the code through a number of branches and build definitions leading up to production.  

![Old Branch Structure](/images/Exaktime-OldBranchStructure.jpg)

The user story branches get checked in by the dev anywhere from 3 hours to 2 days. There might be anywhere from 2-10 user stories per feature and the feature branch doesn't get manually merged into the dev branch until the entire user story is complete (6 hours to 20 days time).  Then finally "loose CI" kicks in once it hits the dev branch. After this, the merge from the dev branch into the QA branch is a manual merge taking anywhere from 1-2 days and another "loose CI" kicks off.  The QA team does manual tests at the point of when it hits the QA environment. 

This branching structure caused delays of up to three weeks or more in getting feedback from the QA team from once the code was first written causing a "waste" of task switching taking developers longer to fix their code.  Furthermore, merge conflicts were common wasting much time simply trying to get branches into a healthy state since there were so many people working on code sub branches that didn't even attempt to merge for many days if not weeks or months later.

To mitigate these challenges, a move towards true continuous integration was needed.  This meant that the ultimate goal was to have people committing to "trunk" or the main branch daily and that branch was always in a shippable state as verified by automated tests and the code running in production or production-like environments.  Moving to this structure is a big culture shift and takes time, so we proposed these things to help transition to this state:
1. Be able to build, test, and release the app services independently - This signficantly reduced the build times down to around 10 minutes from the 45 min - 1 hour, enables faster feedback, and lights up the possibility to deploy independently and break apart the code base into separate git repositories.

2. Shrinking the branch structure and environments - removing the dev environment and user story branches was a quick way to reduce merge conflicts and lead time.

3. Run the new Git Merge task nightly - In the transition to one branch and separate git repositories for each of the services, Microsoft created a "git merge" VSTS task which tests to see if any merge conflicts will happen if those branches merged individually or all together into their higher-level branch.

![VSTS Merge Task Build](/images/exaktime-gitmergebuild.jpg)
Exaktime runs this nightly and has helped to find and resolve merge conflicts the next day versus having much more pain in trying to merge after days, weeks, or months across numerous developer merge conflicts.  In the future they may enforce this task to run before even allowing the code to be checked in to the sub branch.

4. Setup a deployment and release pipeline based on services - Developers usually would work on just one service at a time.  These services have the ability to delivery end-user value in it self and could be deployed to customers independently.  For these reasons it makes sense to break apart the "ship all services at once" mentality and shift them to be deployed more independently.

###Implement Release Management###

This new branch and service pair release structure in place made a smooth transition into their own continuous deployment and release definition pipelines.  Each service pair has a build definition that builds both services and upon a successful build, continuous deployment triggers a new release for that build into the QA environment.

As you can see - a build only happens once and then this build artifact is automatically moved through the different environments. Since Exaktime is using VSTS for work item tracking, source code repository, builds, tests, deployments, and release - they now have full end-to-end visibility!

## Conclusion ##

Exaktime has reduced their lead time from over one month down to a week, has reduced their build times, and gets feedback much quicker to save time and produce higher quality code.  Anyone in the company has an amazing new view in VSTS on the end-to-end lifecycle of the services which has motivated the team and saved them time. No more time is spent on maintaining a Jenkins virtual machines since VSTS handles everything in its service.

## General lessons ##
Other teams should work towards smaller batch sizes for a release and strive to aim for "true continuous integration".  Consider the question "What is the smallest new feature which could be developed that has user value?" and set that to be a release.

In the quest towards true continuous integration, teams might consider using the git merge VSTS task to minimize or eliminate the pain of merge conflicts.
